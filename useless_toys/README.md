# SAR_Nomographs/useless_toys

This is a collection of hacks I created using [PyNomo](http://www.pynomo.org/).

The two nomographs that are intended to be used are in the main directory,
POD_from_W_v_t_simplified.pdf and POD_from_W_L_N.pdf.  The python scripts
here all just toys I created while learning PyNomo and building these two.
